* Introduction
This report is made by Saivenkat stating the feedback on documentation of College Cloud-2.0


**Feedback
The documentation is good except at some part like i have much time in setting the configuration of router and
running vargrant,Once it is done rest went smoothly.
There is an error at 6.1.1 where the path for log file should be /var/www/html/<.....> here Html is missing in the documentation
Usage is easy to understand
