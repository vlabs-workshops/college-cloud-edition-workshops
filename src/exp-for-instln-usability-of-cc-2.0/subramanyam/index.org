** Regarding Configuration of College Cloud Server
- I was not able to understand the process of changing the configuration of the router properly.
- I tried to search other pages for configuring the router.
- Keeping some images or more documentation regarding configuration might help.

** Launching Virtual Labs(Open edX) platform
- Some introduction about vagrant might help the users.
- I received some errors while executing the commands 'vagrant up' and 'vagrant up --provision'
  which were actually avoided.
